## Deadlines
Assignments must be submitted before the end of the week but they will only be graded at the end of every unit. Late assignments will not be accepted and will receive an F. You can complete and submit a contract that allows you to extend the deadline for an assignment but you must email it to your instructor a minimum of 48 hrs before the deadline. Deadline extensions are only allowed for those unplanned, unexpected emergencies that life sometimes throws at us, and they will only be approved by your instructor if you follow the correct process.
