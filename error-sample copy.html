      <h2><span>Task 1</span>
        Debug your code</h2>
        <div class="section-content">
        <ol>
          <li>Highlight errors: Use the HTML Hint extension in VS Code to highlight issues and help you troubleshoot
            your
            code. Note: If the debugger is not working then you may be in restricted mode and need to turn on Workspace
            Trust. Click on the Manage Gear button at the bottom of the screen on the left-hand side, then select Manage
            Workspace Trust to switch between Trusted and Restrictied modes.</li>
          <li>Improve your formatting: Using the Prettier extension to help you format your code is a fast way to make
            your
            code easier to read and
            highlight nesting hierarchy issues.</li>
          <li>Use the Chrome Developer Tools: With this page open in your browser, right-click &#62; Inspect.
            <ul>
              <li>Click on the Sources tab in the Dev Tools, do you see the stylesheet listed? If not, troublshoot the
                error.</li>
              <li>Click on the Elements tab, one by one, click on the arrows to open up the parent elements and drill
                down
                the descendant elements. This helps you see how the browser has interpreted the nesting of your
                elements.
              </li>
              <li class="box-model">Select this list item in the Dev Tools code. In the Styles tab, you can see the
                styles
                that are applied to the list item, this helps you troubleshoot specificity issues. Click on the computed
                tab
                next to the Styles tab so that you can see the CSS box model for this list item.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Use the HTML and CSS validator service by W3C to highlight errors that the VS Code extension might not
            have
            picked up on.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>What causes errors in HTML?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Unclosed elements: If an element is <strong>not closed properly</strong>, then its effect can spread to
            areas
            you
            didn't intend</li>
          <li>Badly nested elements: <strong><em>Nesting elements properly is also very important
                for code behaving correctly. </em></strong></li>
          <li>Unclosed attribute values: Another common source of HTML problems. Let's look at an example: <a
              href="https://www.mozilla.org/">link to Mozilla homepage</a></li>
          <li>Does code with no validation errors in it mean that the code follows all best practices? No.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

        <section>
          <h2><span>Task 2</span>
        Try out some launch tasks</h2>
        <div class="section-content">
        <p>Follow the launch tasks below and take a screenshot of each one. Add the screenshots to your repo's images folder.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>If this were a real website we would check its accessibility prior to launching it: Go to
                <a href="https://wave.webaim.org" target="_blank">https://wave.webaim.org</a> and enter learndigital.dev in the web address field. Check out all the
                accessibility errors and alerts on the page. Take a screenshot  Take a guess at why there might be so many issues with this
                website.</li>
              <li>Now let's check to see if the website is mobile-friendly (if it isn't then search engines will
                penalise it and visitors will have a poor experience): Go to
                <a href="https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly" target="_blank">https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly</a> and enter learndigital.dev in the URL field.</li>
              <li>Now let's see how quickly the homepage of the website loads. Go to
                <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/" target="_blank">https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/</a> and enter learndigital.dev in the field. Now do
                the same again with the following url https://www.cbc.ca/lite/. This is the CBC's low-bandwidth version
                of their website.</li>
              <li>Last but not least, we would check that the website works flawlessly in all the most popular browsers.
                For this we use a cross-browser testing tool but they are not free, so we can't practice it :( </li>
            </ul>
